            <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They help the site function, remember your preferences, and understand how it is used.</p>

            <h2>How we use cookies</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Essential cookies</strong> — required for the website to work; these cannot be switched off.</li>
              <li><strong>Analytics cookies</strong> — help us understand how visitors use the site so we can improve it.</li>
              <li><strong>Preference cookies</strong> — remember choices you make to give you a better experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Third-party cookies</h2>
            <p>Some cookies may be set by third-party services we use, such as analytics or scheduling tools. These providers have their own privacy and cookie policies.</p>

            <h2>Managing cookies</h2>
            <p>You can control and delete cookies through your browser settings. Blocking some cookies may affect how the website functions. For more detail, see your browser&apos;s help pages.</p>
