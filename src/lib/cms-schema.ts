  faqIntro: "Things people usually ask about GEO before getting started.",
  faqs: [
    { q: "Is GEO the same as SEO?", a: "No — but they're related. SEO optimises your visibility on traditional search engines like Google. GEO optimises your visibility inside AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini. They share some foundations — good content, structured data, authority signals — but GEO has its own specific techniques that SEO alone won't cover. We recommend running both together." },
    { q: "How do you measure GEO results?", a: "We track how often your business appears in AI search responses for your target queries, how prominently it's mentioned, and how that changes over time. We also track citation growth, brand mention volume, and competitor visibility — all reported monthly." },
    { q: "How long before we see GEO results?", a: "GEO builds over time — similar to SEO. The foundational work typically takes 4 to 8 weeks to implement. Meaningful visibility improvements usually appear within 3 to 6 months, depending on your starting point and how competitive your category is. Starting earlier gives you a compounding advantage." },
    { q: "Does GEO work for local businesses in Dubai and the UAE?", a: "Yes — and local GEO is one of the highest-opportunity areas right now. When someone asks ChatGPT “best physiotherapist in Dubai” or “top real estate agency in Abu Dhabi”, those are exactly the queries we optimise for. Local intent queries in AI search are growing fast and most local UAE businesses have zero GEO presence." },
    { q: "Do I need GEO if I already have good SEO?", a: "Yes — your Google rankings don't automatically translate into AI search visibility. AI tools pull from a different set of signals — citations, entity data, structured content, and cross-platform authority. A business with excellent SEO can still be completely invisible in AI search. We often audit clients who rank well on Google but don't appear in ChatGPT at all." },
    { q: "Can you run GEO alongside our existing SEO agency?", a: "Yes — GEO and SEO can run in parallel. We'd need to coordinate on content and structured data to avoid conflicts, but working alongside an existing SEO agency is something we do regularly. If you'd prefer to consolidate, we can run both — which is where the real compounding happens." },
  ],
  closing: "Your business shows up when AI answers your customers' questions — recommended by name, before they ever visit a website. In a market where most competitors haven't started, that's a significant and compounding advantage.",
