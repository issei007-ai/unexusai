/**
 * The chat script. This is the only file you edit to change what the bot says.
 *
 * Rule of thumb: the bot never tells a visitor to go contact us — it answers
 * the question, then takes their details and books the call. The only place
 * contact details appear is `error`, when the capture itself has failed.
 *
 * To add a flow:
 *   1. Add a node here with `bot` (what it says) and `options` (where it goes).
 *   2. Link it from an existing node's `options` so it's reachable.
